# Esteban Meza Work Day Scheduler

A calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

This aplication pulls from the library of [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to work with dates and times. `Moment.js` has historically been the most popular date/time library but is no longer supported by its developers.
